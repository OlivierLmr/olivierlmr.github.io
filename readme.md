# From slides.com to here
- Export from slides.com, following their instructions. The contents of the styles tag they ask you to copy should be copied only the first time inside of a .css file. You may want to reformat it.
    - Do **NOT** reformat the HTML code, as there are `<pre>` tags that would be reformatted as well, ending in weirdities.
- Run slidesToReveal.py from the rood directory of this repository. This is necessary to make some changes, for example change "data-name" to "data-id".
